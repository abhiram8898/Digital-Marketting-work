        <p>
          Christeena is a Jakarta-based design engineer with a passion for
          transforming complex challenges into simple, elegant design solutions.
          Her work spans digital interfaces, interactive experiences, and the
          convergence of design and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work spans a diverse range of disciplines, from crafting{" "}
          <Link href="/work">intuitive digital interfaces</Link> to designing
          immersive interactive experiences. I’m particularly interested in the
          intersection of design and engineering, where aesthetics meet
          functionality. I believe that the best solutions arise from a balance
          of creativity and technical rigor, and I enjoy the challenge of
          finding that balance in every project I undertake.
